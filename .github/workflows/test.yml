# Trigger conditions: run this workflow on push or pull request events to main branch
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

# Define the jobs that this workflow will run
jobs:
  # Job name: test
  test:
    # Use the latest Ubuntu runner provided by GitHub
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    # Steps are executed sequentially within the job
    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the repository code
      # This action clones your repo so the workflow can access it
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      # Step 2: Set up Python environment
      # Install Python 3.11 on the runner
      - name: Set up Python 3.11
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'
      
      # Step 3: Install project dependencies
      # Upgrade pip and install all packages from requirements.txt
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt
      
      # Step 4: Run tests with pytest
      # pytest will exit with code 1 if any test fails, causing the workflow to fail
      # This ensures a ✅ (pass) or ❌ (fail) status appears on your commits
      - name: Run tests
        run: pytest
